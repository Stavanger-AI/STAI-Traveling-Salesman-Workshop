# STAI-Traveling-Salesman-Workshop

The AI uses a technique called Q-learning to help a "traveling salesperson" find the shortest route to visit a list of cities exactly once and return to the starting city. It does this by learning which city to go to next, based on the distances between cities and the goal of minimizing total travel distance. The AI explores different routes, learns from its choices, and gradually figures out the best order to visit the cities.

## Installing Packages from `requirements.txt`

To install the Python packages listed in a `requirements.txt` file, you can use the `pip` package manager. The `requirements.txt` file typically contains a list of package names and their versions that are required for a Python project. Here are the steps to install the packages from a `requirements.txt` file:

1.  **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**: To begin, open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

2.  **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your `requirements.txt` file is located. For example:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
